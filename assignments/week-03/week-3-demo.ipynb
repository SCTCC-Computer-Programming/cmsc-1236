        "## Learning Python 6e (Ch. 8–9): Collections (Sequences, Mappings, Sets) + `pathlib`\n",
        "\n",
        "CMSC 1203 introduced lists, dictionaries, and sets with an emphasis on correct use: create a data structure, loop over it, and produce correct output. Chapters 8–9 build on that foundation by explaining how Python’s built-in types behave at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, the term collection type refers to a built-in type that groups multiple values into a single object (for example: list, dict, set, and tuple). The goal is to understand how these types store and share references, and how operations on them affect program behavior as code and data structures become larger.\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing these examples, you should be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* explain the difference between identity and equality (`is` vs `==`)\n",
        "* distinguish rebinding from in-place mutation and predict when aliasing causes a change to appear in more than one place\n",
        "* use list operations shown in the reading (including slice assignment and nested list construction) and predict when they modify an existing list\n",
        "* describe key dictionary behaviors emphasized in the reading: insertion order, safe key access, and controlled updates\n",
        "* use sets for uniqueness and understand why set elements must be hashable\n",
        "* explain why tuples are used for fixed groupings and why item assignment is not allowed\n",
        "* copy nested structures intentionally by choosing between a shallow copy and a deep copy\n",
        "* read and write a text file using `pathlib.Path` (`read_text()` and `write_text()`)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In CMSC 1203, you learned how to use Python's built-in collections. You practiced calling list methods like `append()` and `pop()`, writing list comprehensions, using dictionary methods like `get()` and `update()`, and reading and writing files with `open()`. \n",
        "\n",
        "This unit shifts focus to **how Python works internally**. The goal is to understand what happens when you assign one variable to another, why a change to one list sometimes affects another variable, and when copying a data structure actually matters. These concepts explain behavior that may have seemed unexpected in CMSC 1203 and will help you predict and debug your code as programs become larger and more complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Names, objects, and references\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a variable is a *name* that refers to an object. An object is a value stored in memory (for example, a list, a dictionary, an integer, or a string). When a name refers to an object, the name is said to be **bound** to that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "This model is a basic part of programming in Python. It explains how changes to lists and dictionaries propagate through a program, and it helps you predict what happens when the same object is reused in more than one place. It also applies when a value is passed into a function, meaning the object is provided to a function as an argument so the function can use it. If the argument is a mutable object (an object whose contents can be changed after it is created) and the function mutates it, the change is visible after the function call because the same object is being used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python’s built-in collection types (lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples) store references to objects rather than copying them. As a result, the same object can be reached through more than one name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two operations are used throughout Python programs, and they are easy to confuse because both can occur after an assignment statement. The difference is what changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* rebinding changes which object a name refers to; the original object is unchanged\n",
        "* mutation changes the contents of an existing object; any name that refers to that object will observe the change\n",
        "\n",
        "Because Python programs frequently reuse objects through multiple names (intentionally or unintentionally), it is important to distinguish “same object” from “same value\" so you can predict when a change will affect more than one variable. Two comparison operators are used for that purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `is` tests identity: whether two names refer to the same object in memory\n",
        "* `==` tests equality: whether two objects have the same value\n",
        "\n",
        "The following two examples establish the difference between identity and equality for collection objects.\n",

        "### Example 1: Two names referring to the same object\n",
        "This first example shows what it means for two names to refer to the same object. The output will confirm that `a is b` is true (same object) and `a == b` is also true (same contents)."

This matters in practice because checking whether a collection is empty is one of the most common operations in everyday code. Instead of writing `if len(items) > 0:` to test whether a list has elements, Python programmers write `if items:` and rely on the object's truth value.

        "Basic file handling using `open()` and a `with` block was introduced in CMSC 1203, and the textbook’s Chapter 9 presents that same approach as the standard, universal way to work with files in Python. This section does not re-teach that baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, the focus here is a modern alternative interface that is widely used in current Python code: the `pathlib` module. This module is not covered in CMSC 1203 and it is not a topic in Learning Python Chapters 8–9, but it is a practical tool that builds directly on the same underlying file concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "A `pathlib.Path` object represents a file path as an object rather than as a plain string. It can simplify common tasks such as reading and writing text and helps keep file-related code consistent and readable as programs grow.\n",

        "The `pathlib` interface shown here provides a more concise alternative for common text operations: `read_text()` and `write_text()` handle opening, reading or writing, and closing in a single method call. Both approaches are valid; `pathlib` is often simpler when all you need is to read or write an entire file as a string.\n",
