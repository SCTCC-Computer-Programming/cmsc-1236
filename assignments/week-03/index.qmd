## Week 3 Assignments

**Submission location:** No Dropbox submission this week. All work is completed in D2L.

## Part 1: Reading

Read **Learning Python (6e), Chapters 8–9**.

As you read, focus on these ideas (these are also the ideas the quiz will test):

- **Names and objects:** variables are names that refer to objects
- **Identity vs equality:** what `is` tests vs what `==` tests
- **Aliasing:** how two names can refer to the same object through assignment
- **Mutability:** what it means for an object (such as a list or dictionary) to be mutable
- **Rebinding vs mutation (lists):** the difference between assigning a name to a new list and changing an existing list in place
- **List slicing and slice assignment:** what a slice means and how assigning to a slice changes a list
- **Nested list construction:** why `*` repetition can create repeated references when building a list of lists
- **Dictionaries as mappings:** key-based access, insertion order during iteration, and update patterns
- **Safe dictionary access:** membership tests with `in` and default-returning access with `get`
- **Sets:** uniqueness, membership testing, and the hashability requirement for set elements
- **Tuples:** indexing like other sequences and immutability (item assignment fails)
- **Copying nested structures:** what shallow copy and deep copy mean for nested lists

## Part 2: Week 3 Examples

Use the Week 3 examples notebook to make the Chapter 8–9 behaviors visible through short, print-based examples. The goal is to be able to predict and explain results when objects are reused, mutated, or nested.

## Part 3: D2L Quiz

Complete the **Week 3 D2L quiz**.

The quiz focuses on:

- distinguishing **identity** and **equality** in code output (`is` vs `==`)
- recognizing when two names refer to the **same object** (aliasing)
- determining whether a list operation **creates a new list** (rebinding) or **changes an existing list** (mutation)
- predicting outcomes of **slice assignment** and nested list construction using `*`
- interpreting dictionary behaviors: **insertion order**, membership tests (`in`), and safe access with `get`
- identifying controlled dictionary update patterns using `copy` and `update`
- using sets for **uniqueness** and explaining why unhashable types (such as lists) cannot be set elements
- identifying tuple behaviors: indexing works, but **item assignment fails**
- distinguishing **shallow copy** from **deep copy** for nested lists
- using `pathlib.Path` for basic text file read/write and identifying where the file is created (the working directory)

## Completion checklist

- Learning Python 6e Chapters 8–9 reading
- Week 3 examples notebook (run and review)
- Week 3 D2L quiz
