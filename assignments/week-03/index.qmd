## Part 1: Reading

Read **Learning Python (6e), Chapters 8–9**.

As you read, focus on these ideas (these are also the ideas the quiz will test):

- **Names and objects:** variables are names that refer to objects
- **Identity vs equality:** what `is` tests vs what `==` tests
- **Aliasing:** how two names can refer to the same object through assignment
- **Mutability:** what it means for an object (such as a list or dictionary) to be mutable
- **Rebinding vs mutation (lists):** the difference between assigning a name to a new list and changing an existing list in place
- **List slicing and slice assignment:** what a slice means and how assigning to a slice changes a list
- **Nested list construction:** why `*` repetition can create repeated references when building a list of lists
- **Dictionaries as mappings:** key-based access, insertion order during iteration, and update patterns
- **Safe dictionary access:** membership tests with `in` and default-returning access with `get`
- **Sets:** uniqueness, membership testing, and the hashability requirement for set elements
- **Tuples:** indexing like other sequences and immutability (item assignment fails)
- **Copying nested structures:** what shallow copy and deep copy mean for nested lists

## Part 2: Work through the Week 3 Examples

Use the Week 3 examples notebook to make the Chapter 8–9 behaviors visible through short, print-based examples. The goal is to be able to predict and explain results when objects are reused, mutated, or nested.

## Part 3: D2L Quiz

Complete the **Week 3 D2L quiz**.

The quiz focuses on:

- distinguishing **identity** and **equality** in code output (`is` vs `==`)
- recognizing when two names refer to the **same object** (aliasing)
- determining whether a list operation **creates a new list** (rebinding) or **changes an existing list** (mutation)
- predicting outcomes of **slice assignment** and nested list construction using `*`
- interpreting dictionary behaviors: **insertion order**, membership tests (`in`), and safe access with `get`
- identifying controlled dictionary update patterns using `copy` and `update`
- using sets for **uniqueness** and explaining why unhashable types (such as lists) cannot be set elements
- identifying tuple behaviors: indexing works, but **item assignment fails**
- distinguishing **shallow copy** from **deep copy** for nested lists
- using `pathlib.Path` for basic text file read/write and identifying where the file is created (the working directory)

## D2L submission checklist

Complete the following in D2L:

* **Week 3 D2L quiz** (no file uploads required this week)

**Submission location:** No Dropbox submission this week. All work is completed in D2L.

**Note:** This week focuses on reading Chapters 8–9, understanding the examples, and demonstrating comprehension through the quiz. The emphasis is on building solid conceptual understanding of Python objects and references that will support everything that follows.
