For CMSC 1236, we will create a separate Python environment so nothing conflicts with your other classes.

### What you will do

1.  Verify required tools are installed (VS Code + Git)
2.  Create a course folder on your **C: drive**
3.  Create and activate a **CMSC 1236 Python environment**
4.  “Git” your course folder (initialize a repository)
5.  Open the folder in VS Code and verify VS Code is using the course environment
6.  Run a short test program from the VS Code terminal

### Required tools

-   VS Code
-   Git

### Step 1 — Verify VS Code and Git

#### Verify Git

Open a **CMD Prompt** window and run:

``` powershell
git --version
```

You should see a version number (example: `git version 2.xx.x`).

### Verify VS Code

Open **CMD Prompt** and run:

``` powershell
code --version
```

You should see a version number (example: `1.107.1 994fd12f8d3a5aa16f17d42c041e5809167e845a`)

## Step 2 — Create your course folder on the root drive

Your CMSC 1236 directory must be created on the root of the `C:` drive:

-   `C:\cmsc-1236`

Inside it, create these folders:

-   `assignments`
-   `notes`
-   `projects`

Creating the course folder on the root drive helps avoid common Windows problems:

-   **Short, predictable paths** (fewer issues with tools that don’t like long file paths).
-   **Avoids OneDrive syncing** (Desktop/Documents are often synced; syncing can lock files and break builds/tools).
-   **Makes Git + terminals simpler** (easy to navigate, fewer permission surprises).
-   **Keeps course work separate** from other software setups (so you don’t accidentally mix files/tools between courses).

#### CMD commands (Command Prompt)

1)  Open **Command Prompt (cmd)**.

2)  Go to the root of the C: drive:

``` bat
cd\
```

3.  Create the course folder:

``` bat
mkdir cmsc-1236
```

4.  Move into the course folder:

``` bat
cd \cmsc-1236
```

5.  Create the three required subfolders:

``` bat
mkdir assignments
mkdir notes
mkdir projects
```

### Verify the folder structure

Run:

``` bat
dir
```

Your folder structure should look like similar to the following:

``` makefile
C:\cmsc-1236\
  assignments\
  notes\
  projects\
```

## Step 3 — Create the CMSC 1236 Python environment

We will create a dedicated environment named:

-   `cmsc1236`

This environment is **separate from any miniconda environments** you may be using in other courses, so nothing conflicts.

A dedicated environment ensures that we:

-   Keep CMSC 1236 packages separate from other classes/tools
-   Ensure the course runs on a consistent Python version

### Create the environment (Command Prompt)

1)  Open **Command Prompt (cmd)**\
2)  Go to your course folder (if not already there):

``` bat
cd \cmsc-1236
```

3.  Create the environment folder using Python’s built-in venv tool:

``` bat
py -m venv cmsc1236
```

### Activate the environment (Command Prompt)

Run:

``` bat
cmsc1236\Scripts\activate
```

When it activates, your prompt will look like this:

``` bat
(cmsc1236) C:\cmsc-1236>
```

### Verify the environment is working

Run:

``` bat
python --version
```

You should see a Python version printed:

``` bat
Python 3.xx.x
```

### Deactivate the environment

When you are finished:

``` bat
deactivate
```

## Step 4 — Initialize Git in your course folder

We use Git to track your work over time and to make submitting or backing up your work easier.  
This step creates a `.git` folder that stores your work history.

### Initialize the repository

Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and run:

```bat
cd C:\cmsc-1236
git init
````

### Create a `.gitignore` file

Git does **not** create a `.gitignore` automatically. You will create it so that you don’t accidentally commit:

* Python cache files
* editor settings
* temporary files

In `C:\cmsc-1236`, create a file named:

`.gitignore`

Paste the following into it:

```bat
# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Environment / OS clutter
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# VS Code
.vscode/

# Local environment folder (if you create it inside the course folder)
cmsc1236/
.venv/

# Common local files
*.log
*.tmp
```

## Step 5 — Set VS Code to use the CMSC 1236 environment

In this step, you will tell VS Code which Python interpreter to use for **this course** so that:

- Run/Debug uses the correct Python
- The integrated terminal runs the correct Python
- Your assignments behave consistently across machines

> Note: This environment is **separate from the Miniconda environments** you may be using in other courses, so nothing conflicts.

1. Open your course folder in VS Code

- VS Code stores interpreter settings *per folder/project*
- Opening the correct folder ensures the interpreter you select is tied to CMSC 1236 only

2. Select the correct Python interpreter

a) Select View → Command Palette or Press: `Ctrl + Shift + P`  
b) Type: `Python: Select Interpreter`
c) Choose the interpreter that points to the course environment:

```bat
C:\cmsc-1236\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

If you do not see it:

- Choose **Enter interpreter path…**
- Then browse to: `C:\cmsc-1236\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

3. Verify in the VS Code Terminal (Command Prompt)

a) In VS Code, open a CMD Prompt terminal:
   - **Terminal → New Terminal**

b) Confirm you are in the course folder. If not, run:

```bat
cd C:\cmsc-1236
```

d) Activate the course environment:


```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

d) Verify that Python is coming from the course environment:

```bat
where python
```

Expected output includes a path like:

```bat
C:\cmsc-1236\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

5) Confirm the Python version:

```bat
python --version
```

- If `where python` does NOT point into `C:\cmsc-1236\.venv\...`, you are not using the course environment
- Fixing it here prevents “it works on my machine” problems later


## Step 6 — Test Python from the VS Code terminal

Create a new file here:

-   `C:\cmsc-1236\projects\week-01\test_env.py`

Paste this code:

``` python
import sys

print("Python version:", sys.version)
print("Python executable:", sys.executable)
```

Run it in the VS Code terminal:

``` powershell
cd C:\cmsc-1236\projects\week-01\
python test_env.py
```

You should see:

-   A Python **3.xx.x** version output
-   A path showing it is running from the `cmsc1236` environment

## Step 7 — Import the book example code

You’ll keep the books’ example code in your course folder so you can quickly reference working examples while reading and while completing assignments.

### Create a place to store the book code

Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and run:

```bat
cd C:\cmsc-1236
mkdir book
cd book
```

After this step, you’ll have:

`C:\cmsc-1236\book\` (this is where both books’ code will live)

---

### Fluent Python (2nd Edition) — clone the official GitHub repo

In the same cmd window (you should still be in `C:\cmsc-1236\book`), run:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e.git
```

This creates:

`C:\cmsc-1236\book\fluent-python-2e\`

### Learning Python (6th Edition) — download the official examples ZIP

Learning Python’s official examples are provided as a ZIP download from the book’s site (not a GitHub repo). 

1. Open this page in your browser: https://learning-python.com/LP6E-code.html
2. Click **LP6E.zip ⇦ Fetch and unzip** and download it.

### Unzip it

* Right-click the ZIP → **Extract All…**
* Extract into: `C:\cmsc-1236\book\`

After unzipping, you should see an `LP6E\` folder in `C:\cmsc-1236\book\`. 

## You are done

At this point:

-   Your course folder exists at `C:\cmsc-1236`
-   Git is initialized
-   Your `cmsc1236` Python environment is created and working
-   VS Code is configured to use the course environment
-   You can now work normally in VS Code and run programs from the terminal
