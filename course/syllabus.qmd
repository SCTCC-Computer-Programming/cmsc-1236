#### Prerequisites:

CMSC 1203 - Structured Programming Logic

## Course Description

This course builds on the foundational Python skills from CMSC1203 Structured Programming Logic, introducing students to advanced Python techniques for developing robust standalone applications. The course guides students through advanced object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming, array-based numerical computing, project structuring, unit testing, and debugging. Through hands-on practical programming exercises, students create functional Python applications, gaining skills for technical roles in programming, system design, and related fields. This course emphasizes a programming-focused approach, ensuring students develop advanced, real-world Python programming expertise applicable to modern technology applications.

***This online class requires extensive use of your webcam***

## Course Outcomes

#### Upon completion of this course the student will:

-   Identify advanced object-oriented programming constructs, including multiple inheritance and abstract base classes used in software design.

-   Explain the role of lambdas, generators, and decorators in optimizing Python code efficiency.

-   Implement array-based numerical computations, including matrix operations, within a Python program.

-   Compare dependency management and package structuring techniques for organizing modular software projects.

-   Assess the impact of unit testing and debugging techniques on software reliability.

-   Integrate advanced error-handling and exception management strategies into Python programs.

-   Optimize Python code to meet specific performance requirements for computational tasks.

-   Design a standalone Python application to address a real-world programming challenge.

***\*\*\* STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR MATERIALS AT THE START OF THE COURSE\*\*\****

## Methods of Instruction

Student Presentation Problem Solving Internet

Creative Projects Assigned Reading

Project Critiques Labs Lecture

Film/Slides/Videos Demonstrations

## Grading/Evaluation

Tests, textbook problems, individual projects, video assignments, and performance will be graded. Grades will be updated in D2L and you are responsible for verifying that your grades are correct. Academic Progress reports will only be sent out to students earning a grade of a “D” or lower. Course Grades will be per the following criteria:

A = 100 – 90%

B = 89 – 80%

C = 79 – 70%

D = 69 – 60 %

F = Below 60 %

Grades are weighted as follows:

-   Labs - 45%
-   Video Activities – 40%
-   D2L Quizzes/Tests – 15%

Some assignments will be based off a pass/fail criterion. Grading Rubrics will be assigned to most course activities. Some assignments are automatically graded. Activities may be assigned but not be graded, these are for self-review to prepare you for graded activities. ‘Proof’ files will be provided to you on occasion to help you identify any issues with your assignment. It is expected that you review these when you receive your rubric feedback. Extra credit assignments or additional assignments are not offered in this course.
