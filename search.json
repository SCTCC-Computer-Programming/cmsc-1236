    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nIn these courses, you will work inside a conda environment. An environment is an isolated Python installation (Python + packages) stored in a folder on your computer. This helps everyone use consistent tools and reduces setup conflicts.\nYou will use the following tools:\n\nMiniconda Miniconda is a small installer that provides Conda, a system for managing Python installations and packages. Miniconda does not include many data-science packages by default; instead, it gives you a controlled way to install exactly what a course requires.\nConda (the environment manager) Conda is software that can create, activate, and manage environments. It can also install packages (libraries) in a way that keeps them consistent and reduces compatibility problems, especially for scientific packages.\nConda environment A conda environment is a self-contained folder that contains:\n\na specific version of Python, and\na specific set of installed packages. Each environment is separate from other environments on your computer. This means one course can use one set of packages (and versions) without affecting another course or your personal Python installation.\n\nJupyterLab (notebook workspace) JupyterLab is a browser-based programming environment used for data analysis and machine learning. It allows you to write code in cells, run those cells, and view output (tables, plots, printed results) directly below the code. JupyterLab is used in both courses because it supports step-by-step work and makes it easier to review results.\nIPython (interactive Python terminal — CMSC-1217 only) IPython is an enhanced interactive Python terminal. It provides features that support exploratory work, such as command history, tab completion, and built-in help. In CMSC-1217, IPython is used to practice interactive exploration and reinforce core Python concepts in a terminal-based workflow.\n\nHow these pieces fit together\nMiniconda installs Conda, and Conda is the tool you use to create a course environment. When you activate that environment, your terminal temporarily switches so that the python command (and tools like jupyter) run from the environment’s folder. You then start Jupyter (JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook), and the notebook runs Python from the active environment, using the packages installed there. This sequence—install Miniconda → create environment → activate environment → start Jupyter → run notebooks—is the standard workflow you will use throughout the course.\n\nImportant: During Miniconda installation, do not add Miniconda to PATH. We will use the Miniconda/Anaconda Prompt when working for these courses."

    "text": "1) Install Miniconda\n\nDownload and install Miniconda (64-bit) for Windows. https://www.anaconda.com/download\nDuring installation, do not add Miniconda to PATH.\n\nWhy not add to PATH: Many of you already have a Python installation from python.org. Not adding Miniconda to PATH prevents Miniconda from changing which python runs in non-course terminals.\nMiniconda is a lightweight installer that provides:\n\nConda (a package and environment manager), and\na basic Python installation and its dependencies.\n\nMiniconda is intentionally minimal: it does not install a large collection of data-science packages by default. Instead, you install only the packages required for the course.\nRelationship to Anaconda\nMiniconda and Anaconda are closely related:\n\nAnaconda Distribution is a larger installer that comes with hundreds of packages pre-installed, plus optional tools like Anaconda Navigator.\nMiniconda is a smaller installer that includes only conda, Python, and a small core set of packages, and then you add what you need.\n\nFor these courses, Miniconda is a good fit because it helps us keep your course environment clean, consistent, and easier to troubleshoot.\nWhy Miniconda/Conda is common in data analysis and machine learning\nData analysis and machine learning often rely on libraries that include compiled components. Conda is widely used in these areas because it can install many scientific packages as prebuilt binaries, which reduces installation difficulties (especially on Windows).\nConda also supports creating separate environments so different projects can use different versions of Python/packages without interfering with each other."

This environment exists mainly so that conda can run and manage other environments. In this course, you will usually not do your work in (base).

A channel is a repository that hosts packaged software (similar in purpose to an “app store,” but for programming libraries). When you install a package with conda, conda searches the configured channels to find a compatible version of that package and its dependencies.\nWe use conda-forge because it is a widely used community-maintained channel that provides current, well-tested builds of many scientific and data-analysis libraries (for example, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn). Using a consistent channel helps ensure that most students receive the same package builds and reduces platform-specific installation problems.\nSetting strict channel priority means conda will prefer packages from the highest-priority channel (in this case, conda-forge) rather than mixing packages from multiple channels. This matters because mixing package sources can sometimes lead to version conflicts or dependency mismatches. Strict priority reduces those problems by keeping package selection consistent."

    "text": "Develop a Python program to simulate a virtual pet. This project will allow you to apply and demonstrate your understanding of Python basics, object-oriented programming, file handling using pickling, and user interaction through the console.\n\n\n\nThe Pet class is a core component of your Virtual Pet Simulator. It will model the behavior and state of your virtual pet. You will need to use conditional statements (if statements) in the methods of this class to simulate different scenarios based on the pet’s attributes.\n\nImplementing the Pet Class:\n\nFollow the provided UML diagram to create the Pet class with the attributes name, hunger, happiness, energy, color, and type.\nInitialize these attributes in the __init__ method. name, color, and type will be strings provided when a new pet is created, and hunger, happiness, and energy should start with random values between 0 and 10.\n\nUsing Conditional Statements in Class Methods:\n\nIn methods like feed, play, and rest, you will use if statements to check the state of the pet and decide what action to take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feed method is designed to simulate feeding the pet. Feeding the pet has implications on its hunger and happiness levels.\n\n\n\n\nReducing Hunger and Increasing Happiness:\n\nWhen the feed method is called, first check the pet’s current hunger level (self.hunger).\nIf self.hunger is greater than 0, it indicates that the pet is hungry. In this case, reduce self.hunger by 1 to represent feeding the pet. Ensure self.hunger does not go below 0.\nAfter feeding, increase self.happiness by 1. However, ensure that self.happiness does not exceed 10.\n\nManaging Happiness When Not Hungry:\n\nIf self.hunger is already at 0 (meaning the pet is not hungry), feeding the pet doesn’t reduce hunger will affect its happiness. Reduce self.happiness by 1, since overfeeding will cause discomfort.\n\nReturning Feedback:\n\nReturn a feedback string that reflects the pet’s reaction to being fed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe play method simulates the interaction of playing with the pet. This activity affects the pet’s happiness and energy levels.\n\n\n\n\nHandling Sadness:\n\nBefore initiating play, check if the pet’s happiness level (self.happiness) is at 0.\nIf self.happiness is 0, it indicates that the pet is too sad to engage in play.\n\nHandling Tiredness:\n\nCheck the pet’s energy level (self.energy).\nIf self.energy is 0, it means the pet is too tired to play.\n\nPlaying with the Pet:\n\nIf the pet is neither too sad nor too tired (i.e., self.happiness is above 0 and self.energy is above 0), proceed to play with the pet.\nIncrease self.happiness by 1 to represent the positive effect of playing. However, ensure that self.happiness does not exceed 10.\nDecrease self.energy by 1 to account for the energy expended during play. However, it’s important to ensure that self.energy does not fall below 0.\n\nReturning Feedback:\n\nReturn a feedback string that reflects the pet’s reaction to playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest method is designed to simulate the pet resting, which affects its energy and happiness levels. Resting is essential for the pet to regain energy, but it might also affect its happiness if it becomes bored or inactive.\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Energy:\n\nCheck the pet’s current energy level (self.energy).\nIf self.energy is less than 10, it indicates the pet could benefit from rest. Increase self.energy by 1 to represent the energy regained from resting. However, ensure that self.energy does not exceed 10.\n\nManaging Happiness When Energy is at Maximum:\n\nIf self.energy is already at 10 (meaning the pet is fully rested), resting will affect its happiness.\nIf self.energy is already at 10 and self.happiness is greater than 0, reduce self.happiness it by 1 to represent a slight decrease in happiness due to inactivity or boredom. Be sure to prevent self.happiness from going below 0.\n\nReturning Feedback:\n\nReturn a feedback string that reflects the pet’s reaction to resting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe customize method allows the user to change the pet’s appearance by setting new values for the color and type attributes.\n\n\n\n\nSetting New Attributes:\n\nThe method takes two parameters, color and pet_type, and assigns them to the pet’s color and type attributes.\nThis allows the user to update the pet’s appearance during the simulation. Display the changed output to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status method provides a summary of the current state of the animal, including its hunger, happiness, energy, color, and type. This method is crucial for understanding the animal’s overall well-being at any given moment.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Status Summary:\n\nThe method compiles a string that summarizes the animal’s current status.\nThis summary includes the animal’s name and its current hunger, happiness, energy, color, and type.\n\nString Formatting:\n\nCreate a readable and well-formatted summary.\nEach attribute (hunger, happiness, energy, color, type) should be on a separate line for clarity.\n\nReturning the Summary:\n\nThe method returns the formatted string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe is_happy method is designed to evaluate the animal’s happiness level and determine if the animal is currently happy. This method provides a boolean result based on the happiness attribute.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Happiness:\n\nThe method assesses whether the animal’s happiness level (self.happiness) is below or above 5.\nIf self.happiness is above 5 the animal is considered to be happy.\n\nReturning a Boolean Result:\n\nThe method returns True if the animal’s happiness is above 5, indicating that the animal is happy.\nIt returns False if the happiness level is 5 or lower, indicating that the animal is not happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour main() function serves as the interaction hub between the user and their virtual pet. It will manage user inputs through a menu system and trigger appropriate actions based on the user’s choices.\n\n\n\n\nImplement a menu system that displays a list of possible actions the user can perform. These actions include:\n\nFeeding the pet\nPlaying with the pet\nLetting the pet rest\nChecking the pet’s status\nCustomizing the pet’s appearance\nSaving the pet’s state and exiting the program\n\nUse an input prompt to allow the user to select an action and then call the corresponding method from the Pet class.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the program gracefully handles invalid menu choices. (This needs to be demonstrated in submission video).\nDisplay an error message if the user inputs an invalid option and show the menu again for a valid selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse pickling to save and load the pet’s state. Implement a save_pet and a load_pet function in the main() for this purpose.\nEnsure the program can handle situations where no saved data exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Virtual Pet Simulator!\n\nIn this program, you will create and take care of a virtual pet.\nYou can feed, play with, and let your pet rest to maintain its health and happiness.\nYou can also customize your pet's appearance and save its state to continue later.\nUse the menu to interact with your pet and make sure it stays happy and healthy!\n\nLet's get started!\n\nWhat is your pet's name?

    "section": "Course Policies/Practices",
    "text": "Course Policies/Practices\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is highly valued at St. Cloud Technical & Community College and throughout higher education. Maintaining academic integrity is the responsibility of every member of the college community: faculty, staff, administrators and students. Academic integrity requires students to refrain from engaging in or tolerating acts including, but not limited to, submitting false academic records, cheating, plagiarizing, altering, forging, or misusing a college academic record; acquiring or using test materials without faculty permission; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonest grades, honors, or awards.\nAny violation of the St. Cloud Technical & Community College’s Academic Integrity Policy S3.28 is considered a disciplinary offense and will be subject to the policies of this instructor, entrance into the Academic Integrity Database, and possible disciplinary action as outlined in the Academic Integrity Procedure S3.28.1. Students accused of academic dishonesty may appeal the decision. Students may review the Academic Integrity process and access the Academic Integrity Appeal Form at https://www.sctcc.edu/academic-integrity.\nClass policy for Academic Integrity Violations will result in a reduction of your grade.\nhttp://sctcc.edu/sites/default/files/policies/S3.24%20Complaint%20Grievance.pdf\n\n\nClassroom Behavior\nAttendance is a necessary part of this course. Refer to the attendance policy outlined later in the syllabus\nOnline discussions should be civilized and respectful to everyone and relevant to the topic we are discussing.\nDisruptive behavior on any communication platform will not be tolerated.\nYou are expected to do your own work unless otherwise directed. Cheating, plagiarism, and any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity policy for details.\nAny indication of inebriation or being under the influence, and/or displaying of alcohol or use of paraphernalia that could be associated with drug usage during assignments/course activities will result in removal from the session and/or course. No smoking during any online sessions. My policy is to remove you from the course and leave it to you to file a grievance to return.\nMeaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged, but this also requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to listen, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will always be expected in this course. One’s words and use of language should be temperate and within acceptable bounds of civility and decency.\nDisruptive behaviors, including excessive talking about off topic items, arriving late to the start of meetings or returning late from breaks, sleeping, reading, or watching media, or game playing is not permitted and will result in a grade penalty.\nExtreme disruptive behavior, fighting (verbally), using repetitive profanity, personal or physical threats or insults, and angry outbursts, will result in your removal from the course in accordance with policies and procedures outlined in the SCTCC’s Code of Student Conduct.\nIf a student’s disruptive behavior causes them to miss an assignment, they will not receive credit for that assignment. If a student has been sanctioned due to disruptive behavior, they waive the right to a warning on a second occurrence.\n\n\nData Privacy and Student Course Progress\nStudents are encouraged to take ownership over their academic progress and communicate with faculty directly for any questions or concerns regarding their coursework. I am reachable at my listed contact information and office hours on this syllabus and happy to discuss your progress with you.\nPer the College’s Student Data Practices policy, I am unable to share information about a student’s course progress to anyone other than the student, including third parties such as parents/guardians, unless a current Information Release is on file with the Records and Registration Office. Faculty are often unable to confirm if an Information Release is on file, so it is always preferred that the student speak with the faculty one-on-one.\nBecause of the items outlined above, should a third party contact me directly with a question or concern about your progress, I will defer my response to you and not the third party. Students shall also not invite third parties to attend class meetings (online), as this causes a disruption to the learning environment.\nIf a student would like their course progress information released to a third party, they may do so by contacting the Dean’s office to make a request for specific information to be shared with the third party.\n\n\nComputer Requirements\nA Computer meeting the program requirements and able to run multiple instances of Windows or Linux OS concurrently (using virtualization) is required for this class.\nComputer requirements are outlined here:\nhttps://www.sctcc.edu/degrees-programs/computer-programming\n\n\nD2L\nA fundamental understanding of D2L is required for this course as it is the primary method to communicate course schedules, grade information, and class news. It is the student’s responsibility to learn to navigate and find information on D2L. SCTCC does offer information sessions on this tool.\n\n\nAttendance/Participation:\nAttendance is expected and monitored. You are responsible for monitoring your attendance and your absence count.\nAttendance will be determined by up to two contributing factors, logging into your D2L Brightspace course, and submission of weekly assignments. Failure to log into class and/or submit assignments for a week will result in an absence. Failure to log into class during a week where an assignment is not due and is not a scheduled holiday/spring break week will result in an absence. I will check logins and assignment submission for the previous week every Monday.\nYou must log into your online class and complete an activity by 11:30 PM on the first Wednesday of the first week of class. Failure to log in will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two consecutive weeks of class will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two total weeks of class (non-consecutive and any combination of unexcused/excused) will result in a reduction of one letter grade (10% of total points). Missing three total weeks of class will result in an additional reduction of a letter grade. Any absence over three will result in a further reduction of a letter grade for each occurrence. Classes I teach are considered independent of each other with respect to attendance. You may meet attendance requirements in one of my classes but fail attendance requirements in another class.\n\n\nTesting:\nD2L tests are electronic quizzes. These may be scheduled ahead of time or given without warning. If a D2L test is password protected, sharing passwords with another student will constitute an integrity violation.\nTests are not restricted to a specific day for this course but must be completed by the assignment due date as scheduled. You may have multiple attempts at an Online D2L quiz. Time for each question is normally 45 seconds per question. If multiple attempts are allowed, you must score greater than 60% on your first attempt to be allowed a second attempt and you must score greater than an 80% on your second attempt to be allowed a third attempt (if there is a third attempt). If you exceed the time limit on the quiz, the grading engine will mark the test as a 0 and will not allow any further work on your quiz. Always be aware of the time remaining on your quiz. You may not leave a quiz once you start it.\nNote on auto generated D2L Tests: You may not be able to backtrack through the questions on a D2L quiz. The Next Page and Submit Button are close to each other on the test page. It is possible to Submit a quiz inadvertently if you are not paying attention so ensure that you are reading the popup messages.\nTests and quizzes cannot be made up.\n\n\nSchedule\nSubject to change based on instructor and class needs.\n\n\nAssignments/Projects\nAll assignments must be turned in by the due date. Due dates will be announced during class and posted on D2L . Late assignments will not be accepted. A late assignment is any assignment that is not in the dropbox by the due/end date. Sometimes assignments will consist of two parts, a video submission, and a file submission. Missing either portion of the assignment will make the assignment ineligible for grading. Video assignments that cannot be accessed by the instructor at the time of grading will also not be accepted. All projects and assignments should be archived and kept. Any group work assigned is also ineligible for makeup so make sure that you are a responsible, considerate groupmate.\nTypes of assignments you may encounter in this course:\nWeekly practice assignments – are based on the week’s topics. You will normally receive 5 – 7 days to complete these types of assignment.\nProjects – are longer assignments that are bigger in scope than a practice assignment and usually have a timeline with concrete checkpoints. These assignments may be done in a group setting or individually depending on the project.\nVideo Assignments – are assignments in which you will use your webcam and record your desktop to complete a specific activity. Some video assignments are group-based activities. Ensure that you review the assignment and the assignment rubric for specific instructions.\n\n\nDress\nStudents are expected to dress in a manner that is considerate of their classmates and the instructor for any online video assignments.",

    "title": "Using AI as a Learning Tool",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose of this policy\nTools that use artificial intelligence are now widely available, and many of you already use them when learning technical material. This course allows the use of AI tools as a learning aid, similar to a tutor or reference source. At the same time, this course requires that submitted work reflect your own understanding and decision-making.\nThis page explains how AI tools may be used productively in this course, and where their use becomes inappropriate.\n\n\nAI as a learning tool\nUsing AI as a learning tool means using it to clarify ideas, terminology, or examples that you do not yet understand.\n\nIdeas An idea is a concept or principle discussed in the course materials, such as how a process works, why a particular approach is used, or what a tool is designed to do. Clarifying an idea means using AI to help you understand the purpose or reasoning behind something you have already encountered in class, rather than asking for a final answer.\nTerminology Terminology refers to the specific words and phrases used in technical subjects. These terms often have precise meanings that differ from everyday usage. Using AI appropriately includes asking for explanations of unfamiliar terms so you can understand how they are used in context, especially when reading textbooks, documentation, or assignment instructions.\nExamples Examples are demonstrations that show how an idea or concept is applied in practice. Using AI to clarify examples means asking for help understanding why an example works, what each part is doing, or how it relates to the underlying concept. It does not mean copying an example and submitting it as your own work.\n\nIn all cases, using AI as a learning tool should help you build understanding, not replace the effort of reading, experimenting, or reasoning through a problem yourself.\n\n\nAI as a crutch\nAI tools can support learning, but they can also be used in ways that reduce learning. This policy uses the term “crutch” to describe situations where the tool is doing the thinking and decision-making that the student is expected to practice.\nUsing AI as a crutch means relying on it to produce work or reasoning that you do not understand well enough to explain and defend. The issue is not that the tool was used; the issue is that the tool replaced the learning process.\nInappropriate uses include:\n\nAsking AI to complete an assignment or lab task for you Example: “Write the solution for this assignment.”\nSubmitting AI-generated code, answers, or explanations that you cannot explain in your own words Example: Copying an explanation of why a solution works without being able to describe the steps yourself.\nTreating AI output as authoritative without verification Example: Accepting an answer that conflicts with course materials, documentation, or results you can reproduce.\nUsing AI to bypass the learning objective Example: Asking for the final answer when the point of the activity is to practice reasoning, debugging, designing, or interpreting results.\nUsing AI to write or script reflections that are meant to describe your own understanding Example: Asking AI to generate a script or talking points for a reflection video instead of explaining the ideas in your own words.\n\nIn these cases, AI is being used to avoid the intended learning work rather than to support it.\n\n\nWhy this matters\nAI can produce output that appears correct even when it contains errors or is based on incorrect assumptions. Because of that, it is important to treat AI output as a starting point for learning, not as an authority.\nThis course emphasizes:\n\nverifying results,\nunderstanding workflows,\nand explaining decisions clearly.\n\nIf you rely on AI answers without testing them or understanding them, you are likely to miss errors and build misunderstandings. Those gaps tend to surface later in the course when tasks require independent problem solving, accurate interpretation, and clear explanations in graded work.\n\n\nExpectations for submitted work\nAll submitted work must reflect your own understanding.\nThis means:\n\nYou should be able to explain any code you submit.\nYou should be able to describe why you made particular choices (model, metric, preprocessing).\nIn reflections, your explanations should sound like you, not like a generic answer generator.\n\nYou are not required to disclose routine AI use for clarification or studying. However, if your work suggests that you do not understand what you submitted, that will be treated the same way as any other lack of understanding, regardless of the source.\nIf you use an AI tool, ask yourself:\n\nCould I explain this answer to another student without looking it up?\nDid I test or verify what the tool suggested?\nDid the tool help me understand, or did it just give me something to submit?\n\nIf the tool helped you understand, you are using it appropriately. If it replaced your thinking, you are not."

    "text": "Jupyter notebooks\nIn Structured Programming Logic, you typically wrote Python in a file and ran the whole program from start to finish. Each run started fresh.\nA Jupyter notebook is different. A notebook is a single document that mixes:\n\ntext (explanations and notes)\ncode (Python)\noutput (tables, printed results, charts)\n\nInstead of running one program from top to bottom every time, a notebook is built from cells. You run the notebook one cell at a time, in the order you choose.\nThis is powerful for learning and working with data because you can try something, see the result immediately, adjust it, and continue. The textbook discusses this interactive workflow and how notebooks fit into it.\nThe most important new idea is that the notebook runs in a live Python session. That session keeps everything you have already created (variables, imported libraries, data you loaded). If you run cells out of order, you can end up in a confusing state where your notebook depends on something you ran earlier but forgot to rerun.\nBecause of that, this course uses one consistent habit:\nRestart Kernel and Run All\nThat is how you confirm your notebook works from a clean start and in the correct order.\nNotebooks are a great learning tool, but they can also make it easy to skip real understanding. If you only change a few lines and press run, you can end up with working output without knowing why it works. Your goal in this class is not just to produce output, but to understand what your code is doing. When you use examples from the book, from a class notebook, or from AI, your job is to test small changes and confirm you still understand the result.\nUsing notebooks does not mean you are not writing code. You will still write Python in this course, but you will write it in smaller pieces and run it as you go. Many examples in the book are meant to be typed, run, and modified so you can see how changes affect the result. Chapter 2 discusses this interactive workflow and how to work effectively in notebooks.",

It explains what the book is focused on, the kinds of structured data you will work with, and the core Python libraries used throughout. It also explains the conventions used in the book (especially import conventions) and how to read the code examples.\n\n\nChapter 2: Python Language Basics, IPython, and Jupyter Notebooks\nChapter 2 introduces the interactive workflow used in the book. It explains what notebooks are, how running code interactively differs from running a script, and how tools like tab completion and built-in help make it easier to explore unfamiliar code and data as you work.",
