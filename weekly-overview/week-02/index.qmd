## Week 2 focus

The focus of Week 2 is to complete **Virtual Pet v1** and submit a working, well-explained program. You will finish the `Pet` class requirements, complete the full menu behavior, and add data persistence using pickling so the program can save and reload the pet’s state.

Week 2 includes a graded submission. Your goal is both correctness (meeting the requirements) and clear explanation of your design choices.

## Week 2 project work: Virtual Pet v1 (final)

By the end of Week 2, your program should support the full assignment workflow:

- create a new pet (name, color, type) when no saved file exists
- repeatedly display a menu until the user chooses to save and exit
- handle invalid menu input without crashing (this must be demonstrated)
- implement the required `Pet` class methods and behaviors
- save the pet state and load it on the next run (pickling)

## Reading (Learning Python, 6th Edition)

Continue working through **Chapters 1–7**. This reading supports the language features used in the project (control flow, loops, functions, and basic class structure). Finish the reading by the end of Week 2.

## Week 2 tasks

Complete the following tasks during Week 2:

1. **Finish the `Pet` class**
   - Implement the required attributes and method behaviors.
   - Use conditionals in `feed`, `play`, and `rest` to reflect the pet’s state.
   - Ensure values remain within the expected bounds (0–10).

2. **Complete the menu-driven program**
   - Make each menu option call the correct method and report feedback to the user.
   - Implement input validation so invalid choices display an error and the program continues.

3. **Add data persistence (pickling)**
   - Implement `save_pet` and `load_pet` in `main()`.
   - Save the pet state when the user selects **Save and Exit**.
   - Load an existing saved pet automatically when the program starts.
   - Handle the “no saved file exists yet” case cleanly.

4. **Prepare submission deliverables**
   - Confirm the program runs from a clean start.
   - Record the required video explanation and include the required demonstrations.
   - Submit the required files to the Week 2 D2L dropbox.

## Knowledge goals for Week 2

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- implement a class that models state and behavior using methods and conditionals
- build a reliable menu loop with input validation for a CLI program
- save and load program state using pickling
- explain your program structure and design choices clearly in a short walkthrough
