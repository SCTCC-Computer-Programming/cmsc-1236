## Week 1 focus

The focus of Week 1 is to establish your course development environment and confirm that you can run, test, and manage Python programs using the standard workflow for this course. You will also begin the first project (Virtual Pet v1) by building the menu loop skeleton and practicing basic input/output patterns.

Week 1 is a preparation week. There is no graded submission this week, but the work you complete here is required to be successful in Week 2.

## Course workflow expectations

In this course, you will primarily work in a file-and-terminal workflow:

- You will write Python in `.py` files (notebooks are not the default workspace for this course).
- You will run programs from the terminal (and/or the VS Code run tools that invoke the same interpreter).
- You will use a project virtual environment to keep Python settings consistent.
- You will use Git to track changes and document progress.

Before you begin project work, verify that VS Code is using the Python interpreter from your project virtual environment. If you use the wrong interpreter, you may see behavior that does not match your intended setup.

## Core tools we will be using

| Tool | What it is used for in this course | When you will notice it |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Python 3 | Writing and running programs using the standard library and core language features | Every week |
| VS Code | Editing, running, and debugging Python programs | Every week |
| Terminal (Command Line) | Running programs, navigating folders, and using Git | Every week |
| venv | Creating an isolated Python environment per project | Throughout the semester |
| Git | Tracking work history and managing incremental changes | Throughout the semester |

## Week 1 project work: Virtual Pet v1 kickoff

Virtual Pet v1 is introduced in Week 1 and developed further in Week 2. In Week 1, the goal is to build the foundation of a menu-driven command-line program:

- a clear, repeatable menu display
- a loop that continues until the user chooses to quit
- menu options that execute distinct code paths
- basic program state tracked in variables (Week 2 will extend and improve the design)

Your Week 1 implementation should include input validation for the menu choice (type and range). This prevents common input mistakes from terminating the program.

## Reading for Week 1 (Learning Python, 6th Edition)

Read **Chapters 1–7**. This reading is intended as review and reference for the language features you will use immediately: expressions, basic types, control flow, loops, and program structure.

## Week 1 tasks

Complete the following tasks during Week 1:

1. **Environment setup**
   - Create your course/project folder structure.
   - Create a virtual environment for your project.
   - Configure VS Code to use the project venv interpreter.
   - Confirm you can run a `.py` file from the terminal.

2. **Git workflow**
   - Initialize a Git repository for your work. (You can choose how to manage the repository)

3. **Virtual Pet v1 kickoff**
   - Create the menu loop skeleton.
   - Implement several menu actions (simple behavior is acceptable at this stage).
   - Add menu input validation so the program continues running when input is invalid.

4. **Reading**
   - Learning Python 6e Chapters 1–7. (Review)

## Knowledge goals for Week 1

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

- describe what a virtual environment is and why the course uses it
- select and verify the correct Python interpreter in VS Code
- run a Python script from the terminal and interpret basic error messages
- use Git to track work at a basic level (status, add, commit)
- implement a menu-driven loop with input validation using `while`, `if/elif/else`, and `input()`
