        "correct use: create a data structure, loop over it, and produce correct\n",
        "output. Chapters 8–9 build on that foundation by explaining how Python’s\n",
        "built-in types behave at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, the term collection type refers to a built-in type\n",
        "that groups multiple values into a single object (for example: list,\n",
        "dict, set, and tuple). The goal is to understand how these types store\n",

        "as code and data structures become larger.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, a variable is a *name* that refers to an object. An object is\n",
        "a value stored in memory (for example, a list, a dictionary, an integer,\n",
        "or a string). When a name refers to an object, the name is said to be\n",
        "**bound** to that object.\n",

        "This model is a basic part of programming in Python. It explains how\n",
        "changes to lists and dictionaries propagate through a program, and it\n",
        "helps you predict what happens when the same object is reused in more\n",
        "than one place. It also applies when a value is passed into a function,\n",
        "meaning the object is provided to a function as an argument so the\n",
        "function can use it. If the argument is a mutable object (an object\n",
        "whose contents can be changed after it is created) and the function\n",
        "mutates it, the change is visible after the function call because the\n",
        "same object is being used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python’s built-in collection types (lists, dictionaries, sets, and\n",
        "tuples) store references to objects rather than copying them. As a\n",
        "result, the same object can be reached through more than one name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two operations are used throughout Python programs, and they are easy to\n",
        "confuse because both can occur after an assignment statement. The\n",
        "difference is what changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   rebinding changes which object a name refers to; the original object\n",
        "    is unchanged\n",
        "-   mutation changes the contents of an existing object; any name that\n",
        "    refers to that object will observe the change\n",
        "\n",
        "Because Python programs frequently reuse objects through multiple names\n",
        "(intentionally or unintentionally), it is important to distinguish “same\n",
        "object” from “same value” so you can predict when a change will affect\n",
